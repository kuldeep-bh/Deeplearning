# Real-time Color Detection (OpenCV + Streamlit)

This is a small project where we use OpenCV and Streamlit to detect colors from your webcam in real-time.
You can choose to detect Red, Green, Blue, or All colors. The app will show the detected areas with bounding boxes and labels.

# What this project does
